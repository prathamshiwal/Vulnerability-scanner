# Vulnerability-scanner
A basic enumeration tool that scans for vulnerable software or services on any open ports on any given target machine.
This machine accepts IP Address or Domain name along with the number of ports that are to be scanned for vulnerabilities. 
A file with the list of names of vulnerable software or services has to be passed and in result the script gives the vulnerable banners, software, services running on any open port on the target machine.
The file in this repository is just to demonstrate the example.
